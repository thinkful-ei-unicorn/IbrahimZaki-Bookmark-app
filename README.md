Welcome to my bookmark app!

https://thinkful-ei-unicorn.github.io/IbrahimZaki-Bookmark-app/

With this application, you will be able to create bookmarks for all of your favorite websites, complete with a title, link, rating, and description of the site you want to save. Once you have created a bookmark, you will be able to view a list of all your currently saved bookmarks, expand a bookmark to view its details, visit the site, and delete a bookmark from your list. Lastly you will be able to filter your bookmarks by rating to narrow the list based on a given bookmarks stored rating. 

Thank you for visiting and enjoy



As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
